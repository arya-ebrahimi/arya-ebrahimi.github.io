  We introduce Cross-task Successor Feature Similarity Exploration (C-SFSE), a novel intrinsic reward mechanism that leverages retrospective similarities in task-conditioned successor features to prioritize exploration of semantically meaningful states. C-SFSE constructs a cross-task similarity signal from previously learned policies, identifying regions, such as bottlenecks or reusable subgoals, that consistently support goal-directed behavior. This enables the agent to focus its exploration on state space areas that are not only novel but informative across tasks.
